# Docusaurus

GitBook is handy and does a lot of the heavy lifting converting these markdown files to
a useful Wiki. But it looks like they are moving to an increasingly paid product.

For that reason keeping [https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment](Docusaurus) noted and 
available as an option for the future seems a good idea.
