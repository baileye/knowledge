# Kids Banana Pancakes

I usually make a double batch! Can add chocolate chips too :)

## Ingredients

 - 1/4 cup oat (or plain, or wholemeal) flour
 - 1 medium ripe banana
 - 1 egg
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract
 - pinch sea salt

## Steps

1. Mix everything together
2. Place a non-stick pan on a medium heat
3. Cook small pancakes for roughly 1 minute each side
4. Serve warm (or cold later, whatever works.)
