# Chocolate Fudge Cake 

I've been wanting to recreate what to me is the perfect Chocolate Fudge Cake for several years.
The original of this cake came from a baker in The Farm Gate Cafe in Midleton, County Cork. 
After trying multiple recipes that didn't cut it, my Mum found the baker (she runs a shop
in Midleton now) and asked for the recipe. This is that recipe!

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | 7” ROUND | 9” ROUND |
|---|---|---|
| Sugar | 3 oz | 5 oz |
| Butter | 3.5 | 6 |
| Plain flour | 6 | 10 |
| Eggs | 1 | 2 |
| Cocoa/cacao | 1 | 2  scant |
| Golden Syrup/agave | 2.5 fl oz | 4 oz |
| Milk | 4.5 fl oz | 7.5 fl oz |
| Bicarb | ½ tsp | 1  tsp |

Melt fat, stir in cocoa, sugar and syrup.  Add apprpx 2/3 liquid and stir well.  
Pour mixture into flour, beating in, add lightly whisked egg.  
Dissolve bicarb in remaining 1/3 liquid warmed and add.
Ladle mixture into base-lined tin and bake approx 45-55 minutes @ 160 degrees.
Slice cake when cold and fill with choc butter icing.

## Cover with fudge icing
7”  round cake;   Melt  I.5 oz butter in 1.5 tbsp milk, stir in cocoa and beat in 6 oz icing sugar.  Add extra liquid if required.
Best if left to settle and reheated to melt and use.

All above measurements are fairly elastic as the recipe is very forgiving.  Age shown by ignorance of metric measures!
