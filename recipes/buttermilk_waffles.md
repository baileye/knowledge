# Buttermilk Waffles

I love waffles - but usually when I make them they're not great. This recipe makes delicious waffles.

## Ingredients

 - 240ml buttermilk
 - 60g unsalted butter , melted
 - ½ tsp vanilla extract
 - 1 large egg
 - 240g plain flour
 - ½ tsp salt
 - 1 tbsp caster sugar
 - ½ tsp baking powder
 - ¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda
 - oil , for greasing

## Steps

1. Whisk the buttermilk, melted butter and vanilla together in a large bowl. 
Separate the egg and whisk the yolk into the buttermilk mixture. Whisk the 
egg white in a clean bowl until it forms stiff peaks – this will keep your 
waffles light and fluffy.

2. Weigh all the other dry ingredients into a bowl. Whisk in the wet ingredients
to create a smooth batter then carefully but decisively fold through the egg
white – don’t worry if you are left with a few small lumps. Cover with cling
film and leave the batter to sit for 30 mins, if you have time.

3. Lightly oil then heat your waffle maker (or see the tip below). Heat the
oven to low, so you can keep each waffle warm while the next one cooks.
Pour enough batter for one waffle (about a quarter) into the waffle maker, 
close the lid and cook until the waffle is golden brown on both sides and 
will come away from the maker easily, about 2 mins. Repeat with the remaining
batter, then top with whatever you fancy.
